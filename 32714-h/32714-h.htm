<h2>The Great Chelsea Fire</h2>

<p>On Sunday April 12, 1908, at about 11 o&#8217;clock A. M., an alarm was rung in
for a fire in the works of the Boston Blacking Co. on West 3rd St., near
the Everett line. The fire department responded immediately and succeeded
in putting out the fire with but very little damage, but the forty-mile
gale that was blowing at the time carried sparks from the fire to nearby
houses, and soon all the frame buildings in that vicinity were ablaze. The
fire then traveled with great rapidity in an easterly direction, and
despite the best efforts of the department, was soon beyond control. Aid
was called in from nearby cities, but even the largely increased force was
unable to cope with the fire, and could only endeavor to keep it
within certain limits. So intense was the heat that buildings made of
solid granite crumbled, and were entirely destroyed. The fire could not be
checked in its easterly course, and in a short time had traveled across
the city and was stopped only by the Mystic River at the East Boston line.
Almost the entire business section on Broadway was destroyed, the northern
boundary of the fire on Broadway being the Boston &amp; Maine R. R. tracks,
and the southern boundary Chelsea Square. Between these two points on
Broadway almost all the retail business of the city was done. Among the more
prominent public buildings that were destroyed are the City Hall, Y. M. C.
A. Building, Odd Fellows Building, Chelsea Savings Bank and County Trust
Co. buildings. The number of buildings destroyed is estimated at about
1500, while between 10,000 and 12,000 people were rendered homeless.</p>

<p>No sooner had the awful havoc that the fire had wrought become known, than
relief funds were started all over the country, and many of the cities and
towns in Massachusetts gave substantial amounts for the relief of the
stricken city.</p>

<p>Within two weeks after the fire, Lee Higginson &amp; Co., who were financial
agents for the official relief committee had received almost $300,000, and
many thousands of dollars more were given directly by employers of the
burnt-out families, and by fraternal organizations such as Knights of
Columbus, Knights of Pythias, Odd Fellows, Elks, Eagles and many others,
almost all of which established relief headquarters at once. The central
relief committee immediately opened relief stations at the new High School
building and at Lincoln Hall, and thousands were fed at these two places
daily.</p>

<p>By Tuesday, great quantities of clothing had been received for
distribution, and a receiving station was established at Keany Sq. Boston,
where contributions of clothing and household goods were received.</p>

<p>On Wednesday a large number of people were furnished with cooking utensils
and mattresses, and by the end of the week thousands of sets of
bed-clothing had been distributed.</p>

<p>In response to a call from the relief committee, hundreds of automobiles
offered their services in delivering goods to the homeless, and the work
of relief was greatly aided by this means.</p>
